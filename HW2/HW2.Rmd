## Black Jack probabilities

Dear students in your second homework I want you to model Black Jack classic card game.

You can read rules here: https://www.officialgamerules.org/blackjack

Goals of this HW is to train your skills of using r-base objects and to remind the basics of probability theory.

We have a csv file with a classic 52 card deck:

```{r}
deck <- read.csv('deck.csv')
head(deck)
```

I want you to model a game with shown percentage of winning.

Assume that casino has 4 full decks (208 cards).

Game starts when dealer shuffle all cards and give 2 card for you and 2 for himself.

To simplify task dealer will always have 2 cards and only you can get additional cards.
Second thing lets assume that Ace has always 1 point.

You win if your card sum is more or equal than dealers card sum.

If your card sum more than 21 you loose.

each turn I want you to print these game state:

> Dealers hand:

>    king spades 10

>    seven hearts 7

>    sum 17

>

> Your hand:

>    king spades 10

>    two hearts 2

>    six spades 6

>    sum 18

>

> chances 100%


So you need to:

* create suitable objects for casino deck, dealer hand, and your hand.

* implement shuffle_deck() function

* implement start_game() function that shuffles deck, deals 2 cards for you and dealer. and prints state

* implement deal() function that deals you a card and prints state

* implement stop_game() function that prints result: win or loose

After implementation please show two examples of working game and knit rmd to .pdf
